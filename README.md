# Scrabble Buddy Frontend

Scrabble Buddy was originally made to work with chatgpt plugins. The idea was to have chatgpt work as an assistant for scrabble players and be an engaging interface to check words and find words.

But since chatgpt plugins became a paid feature I decided to make a UI to interact with the server that did the heavy lifting.

# Features

- Search: use this tab to search for words that contain the given list of letters

- Validate: use this tab to check if list of given words are valid scrabble words according to the scrabble dictionary. You can also see their definitions at the same time.
